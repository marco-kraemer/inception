# Inception

* This is a Ã©cole 42 project that aims to broaden out knowledge in system adminstration using docker.

* It was made in a virtual machine

## Images
Three images were virtualized for this project

## How it works
- To work with those 3 images, a docker-compose file has been used. Using it, make easier to deploy the containers. All configs, volumes and network were created in docker-compose file
- There is only one port open, 443

```
make
```

## Access database
```
docker exec -it mariadb /bin/bash
```

```
mysql -u root -p

```

- Password: 12345

```
USE inceptiondb;
```

### Commands
- To stop containers

```
make stop
```

```
make clean
```

```
make fclean
```
